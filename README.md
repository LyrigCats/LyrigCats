She blooms softly where dawn keeps its first vow,  
A lyric folded in moonlight and the tender gold of memory.  

Her pen whispers like petals brushing the breath of morning —  
Those that lingered, and those that passed,  
Her thoughts drink the patient, quiet comfort of the earth.  

Then, a cat — gentle as first snow —  
Steps lightly along the poem’s edge.  
Its gaze does not burn, but settles in stillness.  

It is a beauty, mild and unassuming,  
Teaching the world how to feel —  

**LyrigCats**  

The girl, the poem, and her silent companion;  
A luminous flower,  
Whose verse leaves the world softer than before.
