She opens where dawn keeps its earliest vows,

A Lyric folded from moonlight and the soft gold of memory,

Petals whisper of mornings that stayed and mornings that went,

Roots drink the slow consolation of earth’s patient hush,

Her light does not scorch but settles, tender as first snow,

Beauty lingers — gentle, unassuming — and teaches the world to know—

**LyricGats**

a luminous bloom that leaves the world softer for its song.
